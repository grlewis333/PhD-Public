# PhD-Public
This repository contains a collation of code written during my PhD. It is still under development as I aim to clean up code from the 'Raw code' folder which contains as-written code pertaining to each chapter of my thesis.

## Overview
- Code with dedicated repositories:
  - [WRAP](https://github.com/grlewis333/WRAP) is a compressed-sensing algorithm developed for magnetic vector electron tomography
  - [SEM Image Analysis GUI](https://github.com/grlewis333/sem-np-counter) is a user-friendly interface for semi-automated NP counting
  - [Materials 1A](https://github.com/Gio-A-Oakes/Materials_IA) contains teaching materials (references and code demos) for Cambridge's 1st year materials science undergrad course
- Demonstrations:
  - Guide to scalar tomography (code for alignments and TV reconstruction)
  - Guide to compressive hyperspectral microscopy (code for operation and manual for use)
- 'Raw code':
  - ['multi_axis.py'](https://github.com/grlewis333/PhD-Public/blob/main/Raw%20code%20from%20different%20chapters/multi_axis.py) contains almost all relevant functions developed for magnetic tomography
  - Chapter 2: 
    - 2D tomography demonstration
    - Micromagnetics demonstration
    - Extracting hologram phase information
    - Rotating and projecting 3D magnetisation arrays
    - Regridding FE to FD micromagnetics
  - Chapter 4:
    - Basic EELS analysis
    - Demo MERRILL micromagnetics script
    - Nanoring magnetic phase diagrams
  - Chapter 5:
    - Simulations using WRAP
    - Experimental demo of WRAP
  - Chapter 6:
    - Directional Vector Resolved (DVR) metric for VET
    - Multi-axis simulations
    - Multi-axis experiments
  - Chapter 7:
    - Hyperspectral datacube analysis
    - Perovskite crystal growth analysis
- 3D Models:
  - 3D isosurfaces generated through TV-regularised scalar HAADF-STEM tomography
- The Shape of a PhD:
  - A written reflection of my progress throughout the PhD, informed by data scraped from various sources
  - Code accompanying the analysis
